# Stranding SL3 Webs
### A Python code that generates all possible strandings given a valid sl3 web

## Input
In order to run a test case, the code requires the number of vertices in the web, the number of edges in the web, and the corresponding adjacency matrix indicating the edges on the web and their weight. Note that only one case can run at a time.

## Output
This code prints all the valid strandings for a web in the terminal. For each stranding, it prints 4 things: 1) a list of tuples indicating all edges in the stranding, 2) a subset of the first list of tuples that indicates all edges in the stranding that are a w2 strand, 3) the corresponding binary word of the stranding, and 4) a boolean value representing whether the stranding at the boundary vertices are clockwise.
